The project is structured the following way:
There is an index page which has links to each of the countries.
The Bulgaria website has 5 pages-Home, Nature, Culture, History and Cuisine.
Each page contains hmtl, css, php and some pages contain js.
The code follows the W3C compliance.
There are git commits explaining what changes were made and when, to make the analyzing of the process easier.

After that you open a new tab on your browser (Chrome recommended) and type localhost and add the path to the file you want to open to it. Then you are all set up and the project is running on your computer.
